Support for AppImage has been reduced to "best effort". We will maintain unit test coverage for the AppImage backend, but we no longer build AppImages as part of our release process. We will accept bug reports related to AppImage support, and we will merge PRs that address AppImage support, but the core team no longer considers addressing AppImage bugs a priority, and discourages the use of AppImage for new projects.
